Simulation:
Bulk sequencing data was simulated (read count).
Four different evolutionary scenarios were used (G7, G12, P10, and MA).
Correct clone sequences are given in the meg format and can be open by using the MEGA software (https://www.megasoftware.net/).
'A' and 'T' denote wile-type and mutant-type base assignments, respectively.
The order of SNV is the same between the bulk sequencing data and correct clone sequences.
